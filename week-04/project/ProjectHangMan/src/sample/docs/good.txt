I am not happy, but you nailed this one.
You are not that stupid.
Almost good.
Unfortunately the word contains this letter.
I can't believe this!
Please lose the game!
How is that even possible!?
You are cheating!
Aaaaaaargh!
Come on! Let ME win!
This is so unfair!
I do not like you.
Dammit!
Perhaps I should redefine the database.
I would make a compliment. But I can't.
I don't wanna play anymore.
F_CK, you are right.
A better person would say: nice job.
OK, that's it. I quit.
I'm fed up with this.
Your success makes me sad.
Son of a ~@#$%!
